[00:07.63] There's nothing colder
[00:08.96] Than your shoulder
[00:09.75] When you're dragging me along
[00:11.69] Like you do, like you do
[00:23.69] 
[00:15.42] And then you switch up
[00:16.56] With no warning
[00:17.77] And you kiss me like you want it
[00:19.55] How rude, how rude
[00:28.55] 
[00:22.76] But I kinda like it anyways
[00:25.70] I don't mind
[00:26.57] If this is gonna take a million days
[00:29.54] I know you'll come around
[00:31.41] To me eventually
[00:33.57] If you sit back, relax
[00:35.66] Enjoy my company
[00:37.83] My company
[00:42.83] 
[00:39.81] Once you know
[00:41.65] What my love's gonna feel like
[00:44.11] Nothing else
[00:45.07] Will feel right
[00:46.31] You can feel like
[00:47.96] Moonbeam ice cream
[00:50.08] Taking off your blue jeans
[00:52.19] Dancing at the movies
[01:02.69] 
[00:54.38] 'Cause it feels
[00:55.41] So mystical
[00:57.34] Magical oh baby
[00:59.52] 'Cause once you know
[01:01.11] Once you know
[01:02.58] My love is
[01:03.61] So mystical, magical
[01:06.46] Oh baby!
[01:07.76] 'Cause once you know
[01:09.15] Once you know
[01:15.65] 
[01:12.36] My little hard-to-get baby
[01:14.29] I want to give you the world
[01:16.43] Not saying you gotta chase me
[01:18.23] But I wouldn't mind it
[01:20.04] If you gave me just a little bit of
[01:22.09] Something we can work it with
[01:24.04] But all you do is push me out
[01:38.54] 
[01:27.61] But I like it anyways
[01:29.63] 'Cause I think
[01:30.54] I'm getting closer to you everyday
[01:33.79] I know you'll come around
[01:35.38] To me eventually
[01:37.76] Just sit back, relax
[01:39.60] Enjoy my company
[01:47.60] 
[01:42.14] Oh baby! Trust me
[01:44.18] Once you know
[01:45.66] What my love's gonna feel like
[01:48.15] Nothing else will feel right
[01:50.44] You can feel like
[01:52.06] Moonbeam ice cream
[01:53.94] Taking off your blue jeans
[01:56.11] Dancing at the movies
[02:06.61] 
[01:58.37] 'Cause it feels
[01:59.28] So mystical, magical
[02:02.52] Oh baby!
[02:03.68] 'Cause, once you know
[02:05.26] Once you know
[02:06.51] My love is
[02:07.54] So mystical, magical
[02:10.31] Oh baby!
[02:11.68] 'Cause once you know
[02:13.60] Once you know
[02:20.10] 
[02:16.69] Once you know what my love's going to feel like
[02:24.49] Moonbeam ice cream
[02:26.12] Nothing else will feel right
[02:40.12] 
[02:32.04] Mystical, magical oh baby
[02:35.89] It's mystical, magical
