There's nothing colder than
your shoulder when
you're dragging me along
like you do
Like you do
And then you switch up with
no warning and you kiss me
like you want it, how rude
How rude
But I kinda like it anyways
I don't mind if this is
gonna take a million days
I know you'll come around
To me eventually
If you sit back, relax,
enjoy my company
My company
Once you know what my
love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right
You can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream,
taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies
'Cause it feels so
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know
Once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know
Once you know
My little hard-to-get baby
I wanna give you the world
Not saying you gotta chase me
But I wouldn't mind it
If you gave me just a little bit
Of something we can work it with
But all you do is push me out
(Ha)
But I like it anyways
'Cause I think I'm
getting closer to you every day
I know you'll come around
To me eventually
Just sit back, relax,
enjoy my company
Oh, baby, trust me
Once you know what my
love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right
You can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream,
taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies
'Cause it feels so
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know
Once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know
Once you know
(Once you know what my
love's gonna feel like)
(Moonbeam ice cream,
nothing else will feel right)
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, it's mystical, magical
